# 🌀 Octant Mini
**Earn yield. Fund your ecosystem.**

---

## 🌱 Story

In 2024‑2025, even major DAOs showed how fragile governance and treasury management can be.

- **Jupiter DAO** (Solana DEX aggregator) paused all governance votes until 2026, citing a “breakdown in trust” in its processes.
- **Scroll DAO** (Ethereum Layer‑2 protocol) stopped governance after multiple leadership resignations, leaving key treasury and funding proposals in limbo.

These stories aren’t just headlines — they reveal a bigger problem: **DAOs and communities struggle to turn treasury capital into impact when governance stalls or becomes too complex**.

That’s where **Octant Mini** comes in. It’s a simple, plug-and-play tool that helps communities generate yield from idle funds and route it to grants, builders, and ecosystem projects automatically, **without touching the principal** and **without requiring endless votes**.

---

## 🧠 Problem

Small DAOs and ecosystem treasuries face a familiar set of challenges:

- Idle funds sit in the treasury without doing any work.
- Governance processes are slow, messy, or stalled entirely.
- Lack of transparency leaves contributors unsure about where money is going.

Even big projects like Jupiter and Scroll show how risky manual treasury management can be. **Octant Mini addresses this by making funds productive, allocations transparent, and funding automatic**, so communities can focus on growth instead of spreadsheets.

## 💡 What Octant Mini Does

Octant Mini turns your treasury into an **automated funding engine**. The MVP focuses on simplicity:

1. **Deposit:** Treasury assets go into a secure ERC-4626 vault.
2. **Generate:** The vault earns yield through diversified strategies (~5% APY in MVP).
3. **Route:** The yield flows to community projects, grants, or builders.

**Extra perks for small communities:**

- Simulate payouts before committing funds
- Track allocations with a clean, visual dashboard
- No code, no complicated contracts — plug and play

**Octant Mini is your treasury autopilot**, letting DAOs grow their ecosystem even when governance is slow.

###  Faucets

For hackathon testing, you can claim test funds (ETH or Aave assets) here:  

- [Aave Usdc Testnet Faucet](https://app.aave.com/faucet)  

These funds allow you to try deposits, simulate yield, and test routing without using real assets.

# ❤️ Why It Matters

Octant Mini started as a hackathon MVP, but it’s built for every DAO or community that wants to make their funds work automatically. Even small treasuries can generate real impact without waiting for perfect governance or endless votes.

With Octant Mini, DAOs stop watching their funds sit idle and start turning capital into growth, builders, and community magic.
